## Optimal Interaction With Hostel Application
This project is a comprehensive Hostel Management System designed to streamline and automate the management of hostel-related tasks. It includes separate dashboards for students, admins, and security, allowing efficient handling of room allocations, service requests, outing approvals, and visitor logs. Built using Python, Streamlit, and JSON for backend data storage, this system ensures a user-friendly and secure experience for all users.

## About
Optimal Interaction with Hostel Application is designed to streamline and automate daily hostel operations, offering a comprehensive solution for students, admins, and security staff. It enables efficient management of room allocations, service requests, complaints, and visitor logs. Through a user-friendly dashboard, students can submit room change requests, outing passes, and complaints. Admins benefit from centralized control, allowing them to assign rooms, resolve issues, and monitor requests. Security staff can log and track visitor details for enhanced security. This system reduces administrative workload, minimizes manual errors, and provides a structured environment that enhances communication, improves efficiency, and ensures a secure hostel experience.
